Fetch experienced substantial growth in its early years, particularly from 2017 to 2020, with growth rates as high as 820% in 2017 and 138% in 2020. The peak in new users occurred in 2022, with a total of 26,807 new users. However, the growth rate turned negative in both 2023 and 2024, which may indicate changes in the environment. This decline could be influenced by factors such as increased competition, substitutes, market shifts, or changes in customer behavior.\n",

    "To better understand the reasons behind this decline and guide future strategies, I plan to conduct a deeper analysis of the demographics and behaviors of new users. This will include examining how they interact with the platform over time and assessing potential seasonal trends or external factors that may have influenced growth during these periods. By exploring these areas, Fetch can develop more targeted marketing strategies to enhance user acquisition and retention in the future."
